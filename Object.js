/*
 * object_merge(target, obj0, .... objn)
 *
 * Merges all objects or primatives into dst in order of appearance.  It will
 * intentionally ignore any properties that are explicitly set to undefined.
 * It does a 'deep merge' and will leave as much of the dst object intact.
 * Attempts to handle self-referencing structures (XXX: Needs thought and work).
 *
 * Return Value:
 *	Returns undefined if no arguments are passed in.
 *	If the last non undefined argument is a primative, it will return that.
 *	If a primative is passed in anywhere else it will return a merged clone.
 *	Otherwise it returns target with all the remaining arguments merged in.
 *
 * Hooks:
 *	before(prop, dst, src): Called for each property after checking to make  *		sure the dst and src properties are not the same and that the
 *		src property is not a reference to the target (in which
 *		case in which case the property is just set to src). prop is
 *		the name of the property.  The return value is what is merged
 *		which normally should be src, but can be something else.
 *	after(prop, clone, merge): Called after processing each property.
 *		The return value is what the property is actually assigned.
 *	XXX: The merging of target and obj0 through objn currently do not
 *		have any hooks.
