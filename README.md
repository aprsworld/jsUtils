# JavaScript Utils

Collection of JavaScript functionality to cover corner cases of implementations and add fundamentals that are missing in the various standards and implementations.

## Object.js

A set of handlers for dealing with objects and structures of objects.

Eventually will handle all objects in a comprehensive and sane way that is extensible.  Should be ECMA3 compliant.

### object_traverse()

Object traversal handler.

### object_merge()

Object merging handler in style of jQuery `$.extend()` and `$.merge()`, but more robust and fully featured.  Supports an arbitrary number of arguments to merge into the first argument and "aspect-oriented-programming" style hooks.
